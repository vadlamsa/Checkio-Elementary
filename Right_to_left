Given a sequence of strings,join these strings into chunk of text where the initial strings are separated by commas. 
Replace all cases of the words "right" with the word "left", even if it's a part of another word. All strings are 
given in lowercase.


def left_join(phrases):
    join=','.join(phrases)
    newjoin=join.replace("right","left")
    return newjoin
    
 if __name__ == '__main__':
    #These "asserts" using only for self-checking and not necessary for auto-testing
    assert left_join(("left", "right", "left", "stop")) == "left,left,left,stop", "All to left"
    assert left_join(("bright aright", "ok")) == "bleft aleft,ok", "Bright Left"
    assert left_join(("brightness wright",)) == "bleftness wleft", "One phrase"
    assert left_join(("enough", "jokes")) == "enough,jokes", "Nothing to replace"
